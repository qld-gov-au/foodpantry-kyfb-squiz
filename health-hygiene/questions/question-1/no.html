<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <h2><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>Warning!</h2> <p> Hand washing is very important to prevent contamination in your food business. </p> <p> You must have warm running water, soap, single use towels (or air dryer) and a bin at your hand washing basin. It is better to use liquid soap as bar soap and soap dishes can become contaminated. </p> <p>Hand gels and sanitisers should not be used instead of soap and water.</p> <p> Resources on how and when to wash hands are included in the food safety resource kits at the end of the topic. We recommend you share these resources with your staff. </p> </div>
