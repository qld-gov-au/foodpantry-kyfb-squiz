<h1>Complaints and recalls</h1><p>A customer may make a complaint or report that:</p><ul> <li>food from your food business has made them sick</li> <li>the premises is unclean</li> <li>they saw staff not following hygiene requirements.</li> </ul><p> It is helpful to have a process in place, so staff know what to do if someone makes a complaint about your business. </p><p> Food found to be unsafe can be recalled by the manufacturer. It is important that you and your staff know how to identify and separate food that is not to be used due to a recall. </p><p>You must have a food recall system in place if you are a:</p><ul> <li>food manufacturer</li> <li>food importer</li> <li>wholesale food supplier.</li> </ul><p> The food recall system should describe how you will remove unsafe food from use or sale. </p><p> If you export food (send it outside of Australia) and identify a public health and safety issue with your product, you are required to notify the <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/export/from-australia/recall-exported-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Government Department of Agriculture and Water Resources</a> and follow their requirements for recalling food. </p>
