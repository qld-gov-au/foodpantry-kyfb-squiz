<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <h2><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>Warning!</h2> <p> Frozen food must stay frozen hard while it is being stored. Food that has thawed can still be used as chilled food, but it should not be refrozen. </p> <p> You may have a problem with your freezer if your food shows signs of thawing while it is being stored. We recommend that you repair or replace your freezer if it does not maintain the correct temperature to keep food frozen. </p> </div>
